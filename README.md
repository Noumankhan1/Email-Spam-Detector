# Email-Spam-Detector
Email becomes a powerful tool for communication as it saves a lot of time and cost. It is one of the most popular and secure medium for online transferring and communication messages or data through the web. But, due to the social networks, most of the emails contain unwanted information which is called spam. Identifying such spam emails is one of the important challenges.
In this project we will use PYTHON text classification technique to identify or classify email spam message. We will find accuracy, time and error rate by applying suitable algorithms (such as NaiveBayes, NaiveBayesMultinomial and J48 etc.) on Email Dataset and we will also compare whichalgorithm is best for text classification.
